# Enhanced Application Blueprint: Process-Based API Monitor & Redirection Tool (pbapimrtool)

## 1. Overview

* Selects a Process: Displays active processes and lets the user choose one.
* Monitors Internet Traffic: Captures and logs the network traffic (HTTP, WebSocket, etc.) of the selected process.
* Reverse Engineers APIs: Analyzes traffic to extract endpoints, headers, authentication, and payload patterns.
* Redirects Connections: Rewrites requests to redirect online calls to a local server for testing or simulation.

## 2. Technical Stack

* **Programming Language:**
    * C++ for low-level system and network interactions via Windows API and WinDivert
    * Python for rapid development (using libraries like Scapy/mitmproxy) or even a hybrid approach
* **UI Framework:**
    * WinForms/WPF (C#) if using a mixed-language approach, or
    * PyQt for Python-based GUI
* **Networking Tools:**
    * WinDivert/npcap: For capturing and filtering network packets
    * Custom Proxy or Mitmproxy: For intercepting and redirecting API calls
* **Data Storage:**
    * SQLite/JSON: For logging captured API details and traffic history (optional but useful)
* **Security:**
    * Encryption libraries and secure storage practices to handle sensitive data

## 3. Detailed Module Descriptions

### 3.1 Process Manager Module

* **Functionality:**
    * Enumerates running processes using Windows APIs (EnumProcesses, CreateToolhelp32Snapshot).
    * Filters out processes to focus on those with network activity.
    * Provides a friendly UI for selection (search, sort, and detailed info like PID, name, etc.).
* **Enhancements:**
    * Real-time refresh and alerts if a new process with network activity starts.
    * Option to view process details and permissions for advanced users.

### 3.2 Network Interceptor Module

* **Functionality:**
    * Hooks into the selected process’s network streams using WinDivert or npcap.
    * Filters packets so only traffic belonging to that process is captured.
    * Distinguishes between inbound and outbound packets.
* **Enhancements:**
    * Fine-tuned filtering expressions (e.g., based on IP, port, or protocol type).
    * Integration with a logging system that timestamps and tags each packet by its nature (HTTP request, response, etc.).

### 3.3 Traffic Analyzer & API Reverse Engineering Module

* **Functionality:**
    * Decodes packet payloads, interprets HTTP headers, JSON bodies, WebSocket frames, etc.
    * Uses pattern matching or basic heuristic algorithms to extract API endpoints, parameters, and request types (GET, POST, etc.).
    * Logs this information into a user-friendly format and, optionally, stores it in a local database.
* **Enhancements:**
    * Visual mapping of the API endpoints and their interrelationships.
    * Tools to compare observed API patterns over time to detect dynamic endpoints or changes in payload structures.

### 3.4 Redirection Handler/Proxy Module

* **Functionality:**
    * Intercepts outgoing requests, rewrites destination addresses to point to a local server instead of the original online endpoint.
    * Supports rewriting by modifying DNS resolutions or by using an actual local proxy server (using mitmproxy or a custom built solution).
    * Allows for simulated responses from a local server, facilitating offline testing or API simulations.
* **Enhancements:**
    * A rules engine that lets users fine-tune which endpoints should be intercepted.
    * Logging of both original and modified requests to help debug redirection logic.

### 3.5 Local Server/Simulation Module

* **Functionality:**
    * Simulates backend responses when requests are redirected locally.
    * Can be implemented in Python (Flask/Node.js) to provide configurable endpoints.
* **Enhancements:**
    * Easy configuration via UI to alter responses, add delays, or simulate errors.
    * Ability to load pre-defined API responses based on captured real-world data.

### 3.6 UI / Dashboard Module

* **Functionality:**
    * Central control panel displaying:
        * The list of active processes.
        * Live traffic in a log view.
        * Extracted API endpoints, request details, and mapping information.
    * Controls to start, pause, or stop traffic capture and redirection.
    * Provides filtering, search, and drill-down views (e.g., view details for a specific packet or session).
* **Enhancements:**
    * Real-time visual graphs of traffic volume, endpoint hit frequencies, etc.
    * Customizable views and the option to export logs or API maps for further analysis.

### 3.7 Security and Configuration Module

* **Functionality:**
    * Handles encryption for sensitive data (e.g., tokens captured during API calls).
    * Provides configuration management for user settings (filter parameters, local server endpoints, etc.).
* **Enhancements:**
    * Checkpoints and logs for any unauthorized attempts to modify redirection rules.
    * A guided tutorial on ethical usage and compliance with legal standards.

## 4. Application Flow

* **Startup:** The app launches and initializes all modules. The UI dashboard displays, listing the active processes.
* **Process Selection:** User selects a target process from the list. The Process Manager confirms the process and passes its ID to the Network Interceptor.
* **Traffic Capture & Analysis:** The Network Interceptor hooks into the process’s network activity. Captured packets are forwarded to the Traffic Analyzer, which decodes and logs the data. The API Reverse Engineering module processes the logged data to identify API endpoints, formats, and parameters.
* **API Mapping & Visualization:** The UI displays real-time logs and visual maps of API endpoints and their interactions. Users can review, annotate, and export the captured API structure.
* **Redirection Setup:** Based on the extracted data, the user configures redirection rules. The Redirection Handler sets up the interception of outgoing requests and rewrites them to the local server.
* **Local Server Simulation:** The local server module receives the redirected traffic. It simulates responses according to pre-configured or dynamically generated API simulations.
* **Monitoring & Interaction:** The user observes the flow, monitors logs, and adjusts settings via the dashboard. Continuous real-time feedback allows for live tweaking, pausing, or resuming of the traffic capture and redirection processes.
* **Shutdown & Cleanup:** When done, the user terminates the session. The app gracefully shuts down all modules, releases hooks, and archives session data.

## 5. Ordered Roadmap for Development

* **Requirement Analysis & Feasibility Study:** Define use cases, ethical boundaries, and legal implications. Finalize the technical stack and list external dependencies (WinDivert, UI framework, etc.).
* **Design Architecture & Module Specifications:** Create a high-level system diagram covering all modules. Specify inter-module communication protocols (e.g., event-driven messaging, shared data stores). Draft detailed technical API specs for each module.
* **Process Manager Module Implementation:** Develop process enumeration using Windows API. Build a basic UI element for listing and selecting processes. Include features for filtering and refreshing the list in real time.
* **Network Interceptor Module Development:** Set up WinDivert (or npcap) for packet capturing. Implement process-specific filtering logic. Test raw capture to ensure reliable packet logging.
* **Traffic Analyzer & API Reverse Engineering Module:** Develop protocols decoders for HTTP, WebSocket, etc. Integrate pattern matching and heuristic modules to extract API details. Log and visualize data with an interim UI to verify accuracy.
* **Redirection Handler & Local Proxy Module:** Build the rewriting engine that modifies outgoing packet destinations. Integrate or develop a small local proxy to receive the redirected traffic. Test with simulated API calls to verify that redirection is correctly applied.
* **Local Server/Simulation Module:** Set up a local server (Flask, Node.js, or similar) to handle incoming requests. Provide a configuration interface for defining expected responses. Ensure smooth integration with the redirection logic.
* **UI/Dashboard Integration:** Create a comprehensive dashboard that ties together all modules. Incorporate real-time logs, API maps, and controls for session management. Enhance the UI with useful visualizations (graphs, timelines, endpoint frequency maps).
* **Security, Testing & Validation:** Integrate encryption for sensitive data. Conduct extensive unit and integration tests across all modules. Validate performance and security, ensuring that hooks and packet intercepts aren’t exploitable.
